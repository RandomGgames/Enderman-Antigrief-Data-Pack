# Endermen-Antigrief-Data-Pack
A data pack that stops endermen from picking up solid blocks (but still allows them to pick up small things like flowers)

# Holdable blocks compared to vanilla
Note: Unchecked means that endermen are no longer able to pick up the blocks. Endermen can still pick up checked blocks.
